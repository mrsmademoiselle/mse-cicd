# CI CD

A small assignment to familiarize myself with CI systems, assigned by my university module "modern software development".

<details>
  <summary>Peak assignment</summary>

  Set up a CI system like Jenkins with demonstrable logic. For instance, incorporate parts of your build scripts from the previous task and/or shell scripts. Go beyond what was shown in the meeting.

In general, feel free to experiment with various options such as:

    Jenkins
    Travis CI
    Circle CI
    GitLab CI
    GitHub Actions
    etc.

You can use Jenkins plugins or explore pipelines and BlueOcean as well!

For this task, sections (compile, package, test) of a self developed Ant build script were implemented using GitHub Actions.
